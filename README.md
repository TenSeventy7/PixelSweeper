# Pixel Sweeper

Nice, pixel-styled, minesweeper game. A project for the University of the Philippines - Los Ba√±os.

## Issues running locally?

It is recommended to run Pixel Sweeper on a server before accessing as Chrome now restricts loading JS files in its CORB/CORS policy. [A website](https://pixel-sweeper.vercel.app) is also setup for testing. The website reflects all changes in source.

### Tested on:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge (Chromium) - PC and mobile
