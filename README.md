Nice, pixel-styled, minesweeper game. A project for the University of the Philippines - Los Ba√±os.

## Issues running locally?

It is recommended to run Pixel Sweeper on a server before accessing as Chrome now restricts loading JS files in its CORB/CORS policy. [A website](https://pixel-sweeper.vercel.app) is also setup for testing. The website reflects all changes in source.

## Features

- Pixel-styled Minesweeper game with neat visuals.
- Written solely in vanilla JavaScript, zero JQuery.
- Multiple levels with themes, backgrounds, and unique music.
- "No first-click loss", behavior also seen on Minesweeper in Microsoft Windows.
- Levels can save current level data and can be restored from the menu.
- Ability to save full game data to a file and upload them back for restore.

### Tested on
